    <h2>Gyms?</h2>
    <p>You may be wondering how to get Pokecoins.  Pokecoins are obtainable when you place your pokemon in your local gym.  Depending on how long your pokemon stays in that gym without being knocked out, you will recieve that many pokecoins.  You can earn up to 50 pokecoins each day max, so be sure to strategically put pokemon in certain gyms.</p>

    <h2>Pokecoins</h2>
    <p>When you put your pokemon in a gym, you may notice that when you get your pokemon back, you will recieve pokecoins.  Pokecoins are used for buying essential items to help you proceed to "be the very best".  For example, you can buy Lure modules, that attract the pokemon to you, or Egg incubators, that help you blastt your way through the impenetrable blockade of poke eggs overfilling your inventory.  Lucky eggs can be the very thing you need when you go on an evolving spree, evolving pokemon en masse to get to the next level.  Whatever you choose, be careful, you can also buy pokecoins with real money, but it's not really worth it in virtural land. </p>

    <h2>Wombo Combo</h2>
    <p>Buying items seperatly is great, but buying two items and using them in succession can bring you far into the game.  For example, use a Lucky Egg and a Lure module or a Incense to boost the XP you get from all of the pokemon you catch.  You can also buy five egg incubators and one lucky egg, and when you hatch all of the eggs in your inventory, be sure to apply the lucky egg to see your XP level soar!</p>
